Make a simple plan to make a app, backend that: 

sets up a webap that's mobile first with a map on the left and chat on the right

sets up a webhook to facebook messenger to handle an ongoing conversation between a user and our LLM "agent". 

we create a "datastore" filled with placeholder storm data. (i will list those details ask me for them please) we use this data to create a series of historical storm events with resident data and we will isolate the entire demo around a single resident, a single gov user and a single contractor

the webapp defaults to the map/chat view
